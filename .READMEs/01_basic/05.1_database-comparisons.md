### SQLite3

> Pros:
> - serverless, no separate process needed to run database
> - data stored in a single disk file, .sqlite or .db, which you can easily make copies of for backups or other uses

> Cons:
> - not the best for high usage, one write at a time
> - limited supported data formats
> - large database can get sluggish

### MySQL

> Pros:
> - very fast reads and good replication
> - massive community support, lots of tools and hosting options

> Cons:
> - some SQL standard deviations
> - weaker with complex queries and massive write-heavy loads compared to Postgres

### PostgreSQL

> Pros:
> - powerful, standards-compliant object-relational database system
> - extremely robust: full ACID compliance, complex joins, window functions, JSONB support
> - extensible: custom types, operators, stored procedures
> - handles complex queries and massive datasets well

> Cons:
> - slightly steeper learning curve to utilise all the functionality

### MSSQL

> Pros:
> - very powerful feature set (SSRS reporting, SSIS ETL pipelines, strong security, clustering)
> - strong transaction management, indexing, and concurrency

> Cons:
> - licensing costs
> - more resource-heavy to run
> - slightly Windows-centric

### Firebird

> Pros:
> - open-source
> - lightweight, embedded OR server mode â€” flexible like SQLite but more features
> - fully ACID compliant

> Cons:
> - less modern tooling compared to PostgreSQL/MySQL
